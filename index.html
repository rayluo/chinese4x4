            <p>
                Welcome to <b>Chinese Assimilation Project</b>, made by a group of passionate high schoolers that want to make learning
                Chinese idioms, words, and poems are fun and efficient. The Chinese language has thousands of years of history,
                so of course, learning all the pieces of language that has accumlated is difficult. However, we think that internalizing
                all the bits and pieces of this culture is valuble. It's a gratifying experience that will make one more open-minded 
                and will help you better understand the values and traditions of over a billion people on this planet. It's also something
                can simply show off to your friends.  
                <br>
                By implementing a spaced repetition and the 4x4 technique, we crafted our interactive tools to be as fun and efficient 
                as possible. 
                <br><br>
